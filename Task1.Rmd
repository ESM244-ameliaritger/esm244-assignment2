- What are some important goals of “open science” and how do they benefit researchers and environmental scientists? 

To me, the goal of open science is accountability, transparency, and engagement. When (m)any person knows (or thinks) their work is being looked at by another party, that person is incentivized to do better (or, at the very least, more truthful) work. Likewise, there is less room for abuse of power or resources when research products such as data, code, and analysis are made public. Open science provides the opportunity to share ideas between diverse perspectives, fostering collaborations by encouraging more acccessible science. Fundamentally, it is believing in the idea (and proof) that two heads are better than one. 

- What are some problems with how open science is currently approached regarding inclusiveness, equity and accessibility?

To adopt an "all-or-nothing" approach to open science, you must have money, time, and job security. It costs money to publish in open access journals, as well as time to invest in your data and code to ensure that it is properly organized and annotated so it is accessible to everyone. The "publish or perish" culture makes it impossible to make data public as it is collected, many open access journals do not have the brand recognition (impact factor) that academia has determined matters.

Science is a jargon-heavy field, and open science would eliminate jargon in order to make science more inclusive and accessible. However, jargon is a necessary evil that if eliminated, would also remove a level of understanding necessary to scientific advancement. "Bright pink upside down jellyfish" is not the same as "Corynactis californica/strawberry anemone" (though it does serve an important purpose). Also, open science is only open to those who seek it out - learning how to do open science is often not a requirement to doing science, nor is it universally mandatory for publishing or receiving funding.

- Describe the tools, skills and approaches you are using to make your work more reproducible and open (at a level that makes sense for you - e.g. within research groups, with your adviser, sharing with the public, etc.)

I use Github to organize my data and (annotated) code, and spend a good amount of time on my Readme to ensure anyone can navigate the repository, as well as understand the background (and findings, if I have them) of my research projects. I take methods photos, I publicize my resarch online (through Twitter, my personal blog and website) and in person (through public talks and other scientific outreach opportunities). I make my papers public online (within the legal limits), and have recently been working on writing papers with less scientific jargon and figures that are more easily interpretable by a non-scientific audience.

- Describe limitations of your current data science work or workflow regarding openness, inclusiveness and accessibility. What are some ways that you could overcome those limitations moving forward in a career beyond UCSB?

I have written paper and grant reviews where I opted not to provide my name, because I am early on in my career. I would like to publicize all data all the time, but unfortunately the scientific field awards those who "discover something first" - Alfred Russel Wallace comes to mind - and some data/details must inherently remain private. I view both of these limitations as a cultural issue, but I am keeping my eyes peeled for opportunities to break this culture. My code annotation is very much a work in progress, and I would like to get better about making my figures more accessible. My goal is to create figures my parents can understand, but not lose the level of detail and information I have been traditionally trained to provide in scientific figures.
